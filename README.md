## Completing Assignments

Before attempting to complete the assignment you must first [fork this repository](#forking-the-repo) to your personal account in your preferred version control system. GitHub is the easiest to use for these assignments but it is possible to use another VCS.

Ensure you commit and push often so that we can have visibilty of your development process.

You will find detailed instructions for your assignment in its dedicated README.md file.

### Forking the Repo

- Go to your VCS account and create a new repository (its better to have an empty repo)

```sh
git clone <clone_path>
cd <repo_name>
```

- Now add Github repo as a new remote in your VCS called "sync"

```sh
git remote add sync https://github.com/Optima-Partners-Engineering/recruitment-assignments
```

- Verify what are the remotes currently has been setup for your repo. This following command should show "fetch" and "push" for two remotes i.e. "origin" and "sync"

```sh
git remote -v
```

- First pull from GitHub using the "sync" remote

```sh
git pull sync
```

- Setup local "optima" branch to track "sync" remote's "main" branch

```sh
git branch --track optima sync/main
```

- Push local "main" branch to "origin" remote VCS

```sh
git push -u origin main
```
